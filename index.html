      <h1>Span, Div, Paragraph, Display, Float and Clear</h1>
      <h3><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Spans are inline, they take as much height and width as needed. Divs and paragraphs are block elements. They take the whole width of the screen but as much height as they need. </h3>
      <h3><i class="fas fa-check"></i> We cannot manually code the width and the height of inline elements. If we want to put elements inline, but also want to specify width and height we use display: inline-block.</h3>
      <h3><i class="fas fa-check"></i> I did float spans to the right and divs to the left. In order to avoid paragraphs overlapping with divs, I cleared both sides of the paragraph elements.</h3>
